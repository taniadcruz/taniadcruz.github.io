	<h1>A Collection of Stories of Philanthropy in Singapore</h1>
	
	<p>Philanthropy – the giving of money and time for the greater good – is important for the well-being of a society. For centuries, philanthropists and philanthropic societies, organisations and foundations have, through their contributions, made life a little better for those who needed it. In addition, philanthropy, when used strategically, can promote innovation in social services and the greater society. </p>

	<p>Despite the importance and potential power of philanthropy, there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive research in this field. While there are biographies on prominent philanthropists such as Tan Kah Kee and Tan Lark Sye, there is little research tracking the development of philanthropy in Singapore since its founding as a British trading post in 1819. </p>

	<p>In 2011, the Asia Centre for Social Enterprise and Philanthropy (ASCEP) within the NUS Business School was formed with the main aim of generating quality research on social enterprise and philanthropy. Since then, ASCEP has published quantitative and qualitative research on philanthropy in Singapore.</p>

	<p>The aim of this project is to compile and supplement ASCEP’s existing research to present a coherent, readable and meaningful story of philanthropy in Singapore from 1819 to 2019. Much of ASCEP’s published works are aimed at an academic audience. This project aims to present the knowledge and insights from ASCEP’s research to a larger audience. Greater knowledge and understanding of philanthropic trends as well as significant persons, groups and institutions will help to nurture a culture of giving in Singapore. In addition, the story of philanthropy in Singapore is part of the larger Singapore story. Documenting and writing this story enlarges and enhances the historical record of our nation.</p>
